# fandango-movie-rating-bias-analysis
A data analysis project investigating potential bias in Fandango’s movie rating system by comparing 2015 and 2016 rating distributions using Python libraries.

🎬 Fandango Rating Bias Analysis (2015 vs 2016)

📌 Project Overview

In 2015, a public analysis revealed that Fandango’s movie ratings appeared to be inflated. This project investigates whether Fandango adjusted its rating system after the issue was exposed.

The study compares Fandango movie ratings from 2015 and 2016 to identify shifts in rating distributions and determine whether rating inflation decreased.

This project focuses on analyzing overall rating behavior rather than individual movies.
